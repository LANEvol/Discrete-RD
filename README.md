## Description:

Discrete-RD is a 2D finite-volume implementation used to simulate the reaction-diffusion process on a Voronoi grids no-flux boundary conditions at the domain borders.

## Files:

build folder:   Discrete_RD

example folder: Contains data for test examples below.

## Requirements

NVIDIA graphics cards (compute capabilities > 3.0)

Linux operating system

## Run:

To run the test example type :

	cd example

	../build/Discrete_RD controlFile.txt

Inital conditions and the intermediate states will be stored as PNG images.
